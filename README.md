# Advent of Code 2024 (Gleam Practice!)

## What is this?
I'm a iOS developer and use Swift in my actual job, but I'm really interested in the [Gleam](gleam.run) language. It feels familiar to me since Swift has deep support for functional programming, but Swift is still a fundamentally iterative language. Because of that, and some collegiate experimentation with Haskell, I figured I'd run through the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in Gleam in order to familiarize myself with the language! I don't claim that any of these solutions are optimal, but I'm having a ton of fun using the language (figuring out how to read and parse the data took longer than actually performing the computations for the day 1 problems)!

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
